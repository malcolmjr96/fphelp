- ### Only Advertise Where Allowed

If you receive a PM that violates these rules, please report it. Private messages cannot be used until a user makes five (5) posts. Affiliate links may only be posted in the proper section of our Promotion Directory.

- ### Multiple Accounts
 Please make one account and stick to it. Any reputation, forum cash, etc. that is obtained from the use of multiple accounts will be removed.

- ### Backseat Moderation
 If you see a post that breaks the rules, please simply report it, rather than replying to the post. We appreciate that you want to help, and you can help us by reporting posts that break the rules; when users try to solve problems themselves, it often causes problems and arguments.

- ### Signatures & Avatars
Both signatures and avatars may not contain inappropriate material and may be removed without warning. Signatures must have a total height of 150 pixels or less. That means that, including all images and text together, the signature’s total size may not exceed 150 pixels vertically. For staff members, valued contributors, and retired administrators, this limit is 200 pixels. Finally, no individual image in the signature may exceed 650 pixels in width.
